### Cancellations of classes

You will receive emails from faculty stating they will need to cancel classes. First, print the email, and save it as well. 

Go to Course Schedule Course, screenshot their specific courses that they’re missing, and print out the screenshot. This is so that we don’t cancel the wrong class. Highlight the pertinent information in the email, like intention to cancel and time to cancel, and course number. Highlight the course number and class in the printed course schedule. This is so to double check that the right class and course will be canceled, and to account human error on reporting on the faculty’s part. Then, go to insite > Resources > Class Cancellations Notifications > Create Class Cancellations Notification > Select Campus (DVC), Term (Spring 2023), and Section# (that’s highlighted in the course schedule print-out > Find Section > Verify if the class matches > Print the Class Cancellation posting (2 if it is a physical form, and 1 for online classes, at least one for documentation purposes, these are for the weekly absences report. Make sure, in the physical printout for documentation, you fill out the fields with relevant information. Then, on the printout of the email, write down the number of hours that is considered sick. Collect the cancellations for when Auri returns. The digitally saved email should be saved onto the drive. Auri will create a drive specifically for you wherein you can store the digital copies or documentations. Auri saves it onto her drive (local file system). If they call, take note in your block, then go to course search, and find the specific class that the faculty member to request off. There is a schedule containing all of the faculty members.

All of the scanned files/digital copies of the printouts should be saved under OneDrive > District Office > 2023 Timecards.

### Timecards

Timecards need to be cross-referenced with an excel sheet, so that they are consistent in their reporting. For Timecards, make sure that the position number is filled in correctly. The position numbers/code define the position of a faculty member upon filling out the timecard, and it can be found in the filing cabinet.

There are two kinds of timecard, one for academic services, and substitutions.

1. Personal Necessity Leave
    1. They need to supply a Leave of absence request form that needs to be filled out correctly.
        1. Leave of absence request form needs to send the Vice President.
    2. They can either cancel the class or find a substitute instructor.
        1. You’ll need to also supply a timecard for the substitute’s hour.

When classes need to be substituted, there should be a corresponding substitute timecard and a leave request form, or sick leave.

All class cancelations and the corresponding absences of faculties need to be properly noted in the Faculty Absence Report.

Faculties commonly have two kinds of leaves:

1. Sick Leave
    1. Email and Call correspondence. Note, the time, class, etc.

Leave request forms can be accessed via insite under the DVC Faculty Forms.

### Weekly Report Absence

For absences, please list it under the Faculty Absence Report spreadsheet, and make a new entry in the appropriate row, which is ordered by date. When they are absent the whole day, the hours are 8 hours. If they are missing a part of the day, you count the number of hours of the class they substituted.

### Absence Slip Control Sheet

Faculty members will be bringing in the forms throughout the week, and place them for the Dean’s signature. 

### Guest Parking Permits
